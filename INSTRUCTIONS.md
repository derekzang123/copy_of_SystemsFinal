## Compiling and running the code
* To compile the code, run `make` in the root directory of the project.
* To run the server, run `./server` in the root directory of the project.
* To run the client, run `./client` in the root directory of the project.

## How to play
* When the server is running, you can connect to it by running `./client` in the root directory of the project.
* You will be prompted to wait for another player to join the game
* Once another player joins, you will be prompted to enter a cell to place your mark
* The game will continue until a player wins or the game ends in a tie
* Once the game is over, the client will be disconnected from the server

## How to use the server
* When the server is running, you can connect to it by running `./client` in the root directory of the project.
* You will be prompted to wait for another player to join the game

## Playing with multiple clients
* When the server is running, you can connect to it by running `./client` in the root directory of the project.
* You will be prompted to wait for another player to join the game
* You should be able to connect to the server with multiple clients and play the game with them
* You may try and connect to the server with multiple clients, and given an even number of clients, the server will be able to match them up with each other
